### 0x0E. Linear search in skip list

## Info
Data structure

Please define the following data structure in your search.h header file:
```
/**
 * struct skiplist_s - Singly linked list with an express lane
 *
 * @n: Integer
 * @index: Index of the node in the list
 * @next: Pointer to the next node
 * @express: Pointer to the next node in the express lane
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure with an express lane
 * for Holberton project
 */
typedef struct skiplist_s
{
    int n;
    size_t index;
    struct skiplist_s *next;
    struct skiplist_s *express;
} skiplist_t;
```

## Task
### [0. Linear search in a skip list](./0-linear_skip.c)
Looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list. A common way to optimize the time complexity of a search in a singly linked list is to modify the list itself by adding an “express lane” to browse it. A linked list with an express lane is called a skip list.

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers.

  -  Prototype : skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *list, int value);
  -  Where list is a pointer to the head of the skip list to search in
  -  A node of the express lane is placed every index which is a multiple of the square root of the size of the list (see example below)
  -  And value is the value to search for
  -  You can assume that list will be sorted in ascending order
  -  Your function must return a pointer on the first node where value is located
  -  If value is not present in list or if head is NULL, your function must return NULL
  -  Every time you compare a value in the list to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)

NOTE: You can find here the functions used in the example. You don’t need to push them, we will compile your file with our own implementation during the correction.
